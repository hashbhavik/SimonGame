# Simon Game

The famous "Simon" game, built for web using ***HTML, CSS and jQuery*** - https://hashbhavik.github.io/simon-game/

# Rules to play

1) Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2) Wait for the computer to highlight a button out of the four available buttons (Green, Red, Yellow, Blue).
3) Press the same colour button which was highlighted in Step 2.
4) If you get that right, the computer will highlight one more color button for you.
6) Be careful as you now need to click on the older button you pressed in Step 3 as well as press the button highlighted in Step 4 creating a sequence.
7) Repeat the game until YOU NO LONGER REMEMBER the sequence. :D


# Good Luck !!!
